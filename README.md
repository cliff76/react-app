# Getting Started React Tutorials

This project is a collectin of various tutorials I am working through to learn/share 
React best practices. Each tutorial exists on its own branch. To follow a tutorial 
checkout the branch and examine the commit history.

The first tutorial is a ToDo app. To see it run
`git checkout todo-tutorial`

The second tutorial is a ToDo app written TDD style. To see it run
`git checkout tdd-todo`
